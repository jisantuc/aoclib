This project holds little helpers for solving Advent of Code puzzles, including:

* megaparsec aliases I end up writing down every year in `AoC.Parser`
* a puzzle input fetcher in `AoC.Net.Puzzle`
* a place to put re-usable optimization algorithms in `AoC.Optimization`
* some data structures needed every year in `AoC.Data`, for now including rectangular grids
